 I'm so excited to be getting back to the thing that is what makes me who I am, programming. Lets start with how I got started.
 Back in 2014 I got into a very exclusive program at Ust-Global Inc. called "Step It Up America".  The reason why it was exclusive was the fact that over 300 indivisuales applied to get into the program when there were only 30 positions to fill. Not only did they teach you how to program utilizing Java programming laugage but alsonhired you at the end of you bootcamp. Out of the 30 women that got in only 28 graduated and became programmers which I was one of them. In my time there at Ust I grew to love the art of communicating with computers and building web pages. Unfortunitly through unforseen circumstances I was not able to continue with my passion and work in the healthcare feild as a home health aid to my mom and dad. But now with this oppertunity that I will not squander I will get to get back to what I love and step into the indistry that I belong in.
